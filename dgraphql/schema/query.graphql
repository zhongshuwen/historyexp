  WARNING: This is a BETA Query. IT MIGHT STILL CHANGE.

  Retrieve the last actions, that are irreversible, and that:
  1) notified an account, or
  2) was authorized by an account.

  Results are _actions_, returned in reverse order (from recent to older actions).

  NOTE: usually, the backing service of this method holds a _truncated_ window of history, per account.

  Read the `cursor` in the response, and pass it back to `cursor` to continue paginating. This is a short-lived cursor, especially as the truncation window goes by.
